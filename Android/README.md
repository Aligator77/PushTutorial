# Push Notifications on Android

Setting up push notifications on Android is very straightforward. Simply follow the [Android Push Notifications QuickStart guide][quick-start] to connect your app to Parse. After following that guide, you will be able to send your first push notification to your Android device.

Unlike iOS, Android push notifications do work from the emulator. Some Android emulators (the ones without Google API support) don't support GCM, so if you test your app in an emulator make sure to select an emulator image that has Google APIs installed.
